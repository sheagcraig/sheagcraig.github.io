      <p>Many Mac admins have been relying more and more on AutoPkg to help automate the
task of keeping software up to date. I know personally that it was an excellent
addition to our school’s software update workflow, which was based around Munki
for deployment, and InstaDMG for building install images.</p>

<p>But times change, and our school switched to using the Casper Suite to manage
our fleet, and dropped Munki. Suddenly I had to start manually moving packages
around and clicky-clicky-creating a ton of policies. This made me sad.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2014-12-10-getting-started-with-jssimporter-for-autopkg-pt-1/tears-300x220.jpg" alt="tears" /></p>

<p>Google Image search “sad” some time. You won’t be disappointed.</p>

<p>Fortunately, a brilliant guy named Allister worked through the mountain of
details required to make it a possibility to upload AutoPkg’ed products to a
JSS through it’s API, as well as create policies. This was enough to get me off
my butt and start working on modifying his jss-autopkg-addon to meet our
organization’s needs. This led in a multitude of directions; I created a python
wrapper around the entire set of API features (as well as some non-API
features) and refactored and rewrote Allister’s original work into something
that was much more flexible, albeit <em>way</em> more complicated to set up.</p>

<p>So that’s where this series of blog posts fits in. I’m going to detail the
process of setting up the JSSImporter and crafting recipes that meet some
different workflow demands. Obviously, you’ll need a working installation of
AutoPkg first, and it wouldn’t hurt to have a test JSS set up to practice with
prior to rolling things out for production purposes. Really, the primary role
of AutoPkg and JSSImporter for us is to provide a means for keeping our testers
stocked with the latest software, so some instability is always expected
anyway. While it’s certainly possible to pump packages straight into your
production pipeline, in general, this is just to populate the testing
environment with the latest and greatest, and thus is probably not
mission-critical. So experimentation is good!</p>

<p>Our first order of business, then, is to grab the <a href="https://github.com/sheagcraig/JSSImporter/releases">latest JSSImporter installerpackage</a>
and install it.  You don’t need to fool around with git or anything; just grab
the package.  <em>Don’t</em> Google Image search “grab the package”.</p>

<p>In this, first installment, we’re just going to configure JSSImporter and use
the recipes I’ve put into my jss-recipes repo. We will talk about how to write
our own recipes, handle problem packages, and plan and customize our deployment
workflow, in future posts.</p>

<p>The first thing we need to do is provide some information to JSSImporter about
the JSS and how to access it, and what resources it has available. If you’ve
configured AutoPkg, you should be familiar with how to do this. We are going to
add the following keys to our com.github.autopkg.plist file:
- JSS_URL
- API_USERNAME
- API_PASSWORD</p>

<p>First, you should create an account on your JSS that will be used for API
access, probably even just for AutoPkg. It will need “Create”, “Read”, and
“Update” privileges on
- Categories
- Computer Groups
- Distribution Points
- Extension Attributes
- Packages
- Policies
- Scripts</p>

<p>To add the keys to your AutoPkg prefs:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">defaults write com.github.autopkg JSS_URL https://test.jss.org:8443
defaults write com.github.autopkg API_USERNAME apiUser
defaults write com.github.autopkg API_PASSWORD apiPassword</code></pre></div>

<p>Substitute your information for the final values above. The URL needs to be
complete–include the protocol and the port!</p>

<p>The next part is the tricky one: adding in your distribution points. And it’s
tricky only in the sense that you either need to hand-edit some XML or you need
to use the esoteric “plistbuddy”. Since we’re going to be writing recipes
later, it makes sense to not avoid typing any XML and just edit the darn thing.
There’s one caveat here though-don’t forget that on contemporary OS X systems,
if you edit a preference file (i.e. .plist) the settings don’t take effect
until the preferences system syncs. This can lead to some mystifying issues, so
get in the habit of doing a <code>defaults read com.github.autopkg</code> each time you
edit the preferences.</p>

<p>Fire up vim or I suppose some other text editor and add a section to
~/Library/Preferences/com.github.autopkg.plist that looks like this:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-xml" data-lang="xml"><span class="nt">&lt;key&gt;</span>JSS_REPOS<span class="nt">&lt;/key&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;array&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/array&gt;</span></code></pre></div>

<p>Now, for each distribution point you would like to have AutoPkg and JSSImporter
upload to, you need to add a dict of values. Each Casper setup is different, so
take a look at 
<a href="https://github.com/sheagcraig/JSSImporter/blob/master/README.md#adding-distribution-points">the README</a>
for detailed information on each type. For demonstration purposes, I’ll just
configure a single AFP distribution point.</p>

<p>The documentation lets me know that using the auto-discovery for AFP/SMB
shares, I only need a name and password (for the Read/Write enabled user on the
share) for an AFP share. My preferences file should now have this section:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-xml" data-lang="xml"><span class="nt">&lt;key&gt;</span>JSS_REPOS<span class="nt">&lt;/key&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;array&gt;</span>
	<span class="nt">&lt;dict&gt;</span>
		<span class="nt">&lt;key&gt;</span>name<span class="nt">&lt;/key&gt;</span>
		<span class="nt">&lt;string&gt;</span>USRepository<span class="nt">&lt;/string&gt;</span>
		<span class="nt">&lt;key&gt;</span>password<span class="nt">&lt;/key&gt;</span>
		<span class="nt">&lt;string&gt;</span>abc123<span class="nt">&lt;/string&gt;</span>
	<span class="nt">&lt;/dict&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/array&gt;</span></code></pre></div>

<p>And that’s all I need to get started. Again, check the README for details on
setting up your JDS, or issues regarding multiple DP’s, etc.</p>

<p>Next, we’ll use autopkg’s command line to add in my jss-recipes:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">autopkg repo-add https://github.com/sheagcraig/jss-recipes</code></pre></div>

<p>You can now run any of these recipes with autopkg run. e.g.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">autopkg run Evernote.jss</code></pre></div>

<p>But what does it do?</p>

<p>My recipes are based around the idea of making packages for testing available
to a subset of computers on campus. At a somewhat abstract level, what happens
is that the JSSImporter processor will take the package spit out by the
standard Evernote.pkg recipe and then try to set up all of the pieces of the
puzzle needed to distribute it to testing computers.</p>

<p>First it ensures that the categories exist for the package and for the policy,
creating them if they’re missing, and just leaving them alone otherwise. The
Evernote recipe will ensure “Productivity” for the package, and “Testing” for
the policy.</p>

<p>Next, the JSSImporter ensures an object representing our package exists on the
API. Again, I say “ensure” rather than “creates”, as it will try to reuse an
existing package object rather than make a new one so that you don’t get your
JSS all crudded up with duplicates.</p>

<p>Once there is a package object, the JSSImporter will upload the package to
every configured distribution point or distribution server. This process can
take quite long, especially for some of the giant Apple packages like Logic or
GarageBand. In our case, the package will be uploaded as “Evernote-6.0.3.pkg”,
with a category of “Productivity”.</p>

<p>The next step is the JSSImporter will ensure that any needed extension
attributes are present. (None are needed for Evernote).</p>

<p>So far, so good. Next, groups are handled. Again, JSSImporter ensures that they
exist. My recipes all create a smart group for each product. For most of them,
the smart group criteria is looking to find computers which are members of the
static group “Testing” (which is how I specify which computers are “Testing”
computers), and have the “Application Title” in question, with an “Application
Version” which does not match the one for our package. Note that this is not
the same thing as “older than” or “with a lesser version number”, as there’s no
way to do that without extension attributes (maybe I’ll cover how to handle
that later!). So in our example, the Evernote recipe will ensure an up-to-date
smart group named “Evernote-update-smart” is present, with criteria of
“Application Title” of “Evernote.app”, “Application Version” “is not” “6.0.3”,
and is a “member of” the computer group “Testing”.</p>

<p>Said another way, our policy will be available to all computers which I have
manually placed into the “Testing” group, with any Evernote version that does
not match the one I am uploading.</p>

<p>Next, the JSSImporter ensures that any scripts needed for installation are
available on the JSS. None are needed for Evernote, but some products need a
pre-install or post-install script to make sure everything works correctly.</p>

<p>The policy is handled next. The important details for the policies are that
they are scoped to the “Evernote-update-smart” group as expected. They are
“enabled” immediately. They have a “category” of “Testing” so they are all
grouped together in Self Service and in the JSS-&gt;Policies page. They are
triggered through Self-Service only (meaning not at Check-In, Logout, etc). And
finally, they are set to the “frequency” of “ongoing”. However, they have a
final “maintenance” step of running a recon, so if everything installed
correctly, the recon will pop them out of the smart group, and the user can’t
install a second time. (The “ongoing” frequency allows us to update this policy
when the <em>next</em> Evernote update comes out, and the user can again install
without us having to go and “Flush” the policy logs like we would with a “Once
per Computer” frequency. The goal is to be as hands-off as possible).</p>

<p>Finally, the JSSImporter makes sure that an icon file is available for the Self
Service policy to display.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2014-12-10-getting-started-with-jssimporter-for-autopkg-pt-1/Screen-Shot-2014-12-10-at-2.07.15-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2014-12-10 at 2.07.15 PM" /></p>

<p>A user with a computer in the “Testing” group can thus open up Self-Service,
authenticate, and pop the “install” button on the Testing-&gt;”Install Latest
Evernote” button. The slick thing is that the Install Evernote option will only
appear to a computer that doesn’t already have that version. Once Self-Service
downloads and installs the policy, a recon is run which will discover the newer
version of Evernote, and the computer will fall out of the
“Evernote-update-smart” group until the next update comes out.</p>

<p>Since there can be a lag between when we post updates, and the latest recon on
a computer, I provide a self-service policy to my testers that will trigger a
recon, after which all currently available updates should be available.</p>

<p>That concludes the first installment. Next, we’ll look at adapting an already
working package recipe to the workflow outlined above and creating a JSS
recipe.</p>
