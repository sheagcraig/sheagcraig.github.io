The chainsaw is no delicate tool, nay! Finesse, despite the efforts of County Fair chainsaw sculptors notwithstanding, is not its forte.

Rather, the chainsaw is an unstoppable force for the violent separation of limbs from bodies. By design, bodies of the arboreal type, but at times, of humans, or anything else that comes too close to the circulating necklace of death.

The chainsaw is also a tool of metaphysics. Here, my pyscho-killer alter-egos wield it to expose what truths can be grasped at through the veils of misinformation and sloth.

I am an IT Systems Engineer for SAS, managing their Mac systems.

Nothing I say here has any bearing on the viewpoints of that fine business, nor any other.

I have written some useful things:

## Casper Stuff
- python-jss (Casper REST API wrapper for python)
- JSSImporter (The magic plugin that lets you use AutoPkg with Casper)
- jss-recipes (Main repo of AutoPkg recipes for Casper)
- Spruce (Clean up your filthy JSS)
- jss_helper (Tie it all together, and amaze your friends from the command line.
- JSSRecipeCreator (Automatically make JSS recipes from package recipes)

## Tools for Admins
- yo (A command line program for generating native OS X notifications)
- SavingThrow (Look for and remove adware, based on community-curated definitions)
- auto_logout (A more vigorous automatic logout feature for OS X labs)

## Some Things I Like
- Tacos
- Coffee
- I shred dirt on my S-Works Stumpjumper FSR, nicknamed "Asfaloth".
- I coach CrossFit at CrossFit Local in Chapel Hill, NC. Just ask about "Barbell Club", and our numerous signature workouts.
