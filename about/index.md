The chainsaw is no delicate tool, nay! Finesse, despite the efforts of County Fair chainsaw sculptors notwithstanding, is not its forte.

Rather, the chainsaw is an unstoppable force for the violent separation of limbs from bodies. By design, of trees, but at times, of humans, or whatever comes too close to the circulating necklace of death.

I am an IT Systems Engineer for SAS, managing their Mac systems.

I have written some useful things.

## Casper Stuff
- python-jss (Casper REST API wrapper for python)
- JSSImporter (The magic plugin that lets you use AutoPkg with Casper)
- jss-recipes (Main repo of AutoPkg recipes for Casper)
- Spruce (Clean up your filthy JSS)
- jss_helper (Tie it all together, and amaze your friends from the command line.
- JSSRecipeCreator (Automatically make JSS recipes from package recipes)

## Tools for Admins
- yo (A command line program for generating native OS X notifications)
- SavingThrow (Look for and remove adware, based on community-curated definitions)
- auto_logout (A more vigorous automatic logout feature for OS X labs)

## Some Things I Like
- Tacos
- Coffee
- I shred dirt on my S-Works Stumpjumper FSR, nicknamed "Asfaloth".
- I coach CrossFit at CrossFit Local in Chapel Hill, NC. Just ask about "Barbell Club", and our numerous signature workouts.
