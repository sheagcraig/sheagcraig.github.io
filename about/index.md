I am an IT Systems Engineer for SAS, managing their Mac systems.

I have written some useful things.

## Casper Stuff
- python-jss (Casper REST API wrapper for python)
- JSSImporter (The magic plugin that lets you use AutoPkg with Casper)
- jss-recipes (Main repo of AutoPkg recipes for Casper)
- Spruce (Clean up your filthy JSS)
- jss_helper (Tie it all together, and amaze your friends from the command line.
- JSSRecipeCreator (Automatically make JSS recipes from package recipes)

## Tools for Admins
- yo (A command line program for generating native OS X notifications)
- SavingThrow (Look for and remove adware, based on community-curated definitions)
- auto_logout (A more vigorous automatic logout feature for OS X labs)

Also, I have some contributions to AutoPkg, and I'm working on RecipeRobot with the amazing @homebysix.

## Some Things I Like
- Tacos
- Coffee
- I shred dirt on my S-Works Stumpjumper FSR, nicknamed "Asfaloth".
- I coach CrossFit at CrossFit Local in Chapel Hill, NC. Just ask about "Barbell Club", and our numerous signature workouts.
